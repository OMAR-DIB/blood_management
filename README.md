# Blood Bank Management System - Simple Explanation Guide

## 🎯 What is This System?

This is a **Blood Bank Management System** - a web application that helps hospitals, donors, and administrators manage blood donations and requests.

Think of it like a **digital marketplace for blood donations**:
- 🏥 Hospitals can request blood they need
- 🩸 Donors can register and donate blood
- 👨‍💼 Admins can manage everything

---

## 🏗️ System Overview - The Big Picture

```
User (Browser) → Frontend → Backend (Node.js API) → Database (MySQL)
```

**What you have here is the BACKEND** - the part that:
1. Receives requests from the frontend
2. Checks if users are allowed to do things
3. Talks to the database
4. Sends responses back

---

## 📊 Part 1: The Database View (SQL File)

### What is `inventory_expiring_soon`?

This is a **VIEW** in the database - think of it as a **saved search** or **smart filter**.

#### What it does:
```
Shows blood inventory that is:
✅ Available (not already used)
✅ Expiring in the next 7 days
✅ Not already expired

Sorted by: Which ones expire first (most urgent on top)
```

#### Example in Real Life:
Imagine you have a fridge full of blood bags. This view is like a **sticky note on the fridge** that automatically updates to show:
- "These blood bags will expire in 7 days or less - USE THEM FIRST!"

#### The Key Parts:
```sql
WHERE i.status = 'Available'                    -- Only show blood that hasn't been used
AND i.expiration_date <= curdate() + interval 7 day  -- Expires within 7 days
AND i.expiration_date >= curdate()              -- Not expired yet
```

**Why is this useful?**
- Hospitals can see which blood to use urgently
- Prevents waste of valuable blood
- Saves lives by ensuring blood doesn't go to waste

---

## 🔐 Part 2: Authentication System (How Login Works)

### The Big Idea: JWT Tokens

**JWT = JSON Web Token** - Think of it as a **digital ID badge**

#### How it works:

```
1. User logs in with email + password
   ↓
2. Server checks: "Is this correct?"
   ↓
3. If YES → Server creates a TOKEN (digital badge)
   ↓
4. User keeps this token and shows it for every request
   ↓
5. Server checks the token: "Is this badge real and valid?"
```

### Database Configuration (`config/db.js`)

**What it does:** Connects the backend to the MySQL database

```javascript
const pool = mysql.createPool({
  host: 'localhost',      // Where is the database? (your computer)
  user: 'root',           // Username to access database
  password: '',           // Password (empty in this case)
  database: 'blood_bank_management_system',  // Which database to use
  connectionLimit: 10     // Maximum 10 connections at once
});
```

**Analogy:** This is like having a **phone line** to the database. Instead of calling every time, you have a **pool of 10 phone lines** ready to use.

### Authentication Middleware (`middleware/auth.js`)

**What is Middleware?** Think of it as a **security guard** who checks everyone before they enter a building.

#### Two Types:

1. **`auth` - Strict Security Guard**
   ```
   "Stop! Show me your badge (token) or you can't enter!"
   ```

2. **`optionalAuth` - Friendly Security Guard**
   ```
   "You can enter, but if you have a badge, I'll remember who you are"
   ```

#### Step-by-Step: What `auth` Does

```javascript
// 1. Check: Did they send a token?
const token = req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
if (!token) {
  // NO TOKEN → Reject them
  return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No token provided' });
}

// 2. Verify: Is the token real and not fake?
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

// 3. Get User: Find user info from database
const [users] = await db.query('SELECT ... FROM users WHERE user_id = ?', [decoded.userId]);

// 4. Check: Is user active?
if (!user.is_active) {
  // User account is disabled
  return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Account deactivated' });
}

// 5. Success! Attach user info to the request
req.user = user;
next(); // Let them through
```

**Analogy:**
1. Check if they have an ID badge
2. Verify the badge isn't fake
3. Look up their employee record
4. Make sure they still work here
5. Let them in and remember who they are

---

## 🛡️ Part 3: Role-Based Access Control (Who Can Do What)

The system has **3 types of users** (roles):
- 👨‍💼 **Admin** - Can do everything
- 🏥 **Hospital** - Can request blood, manage their requests
- 🩸 **Donor** - Can register, view donation history

### How `checkRole` Works

```javascript
const checkRole = (...allowedRoles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    // Check: Is user logged in?
    if (!req.user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Please login first' });
    }

    // Check: Is their role in the allowed list?
    if (!allowedRoles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
    }

    // Success! They have permission
    next();
  };
};
```

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
// Only admins can access this
router.get('/admin-panel', auth, checkRole('admin'), someFunction);

// Both hospitals and admins can access this
router.post('/blood-request', auth, checkRole('hospital', 'admin'), createRequest);
```

**Analogy:** Different colored badges for different access levels
- 🔴 Red Badge (Admin) → Can go anywhere
- 🔵 Blue Badge (Hospital) → Can only enter hospital areas
- 🟢 Green Badge (Donor) → Can only enter donor areas

### Special Middleware Functions

1. **`isAdmin`** - Only admins allowed
2. **`isHospital`** - Only hospitals allowed
3. **`isDonor`** - Only donors allowed
4. **`isHospitalOrAdmin`** - Either hospital or admin
5. **`isOwnerOrAdmin`** - Must own the resource OR be admin

## 🗂️ Part 4: Blood Request Model (How Data is Organized)

### What is the BloodRequest Model?

It's a **blueprint** for how blood requests work in the system. Think of it as a **form template** for requesting blood.

### What Information Does a Blood Request Contain?

```javascript
{
  hospital_id: 123,              // Which hospital is requesting
  patient_name: "John Doe",      // Who needs the blood
  blood_group: "A+",             // What blood type
  units_required: 2,             // How many units needed
  urgency: "High",               // How urgent (High/Medium/Low)
  hospital_name: "City Hospital",
  hospital_address: "123 Main St",
  city: "New York",
  state: "NY",
  contact_person: "Dr. Smith",
  contact_phone: "555-1234",
  required_by: "2025-10-30",     // When they need it by
  status: "Pending",             // Current status
  description: "Emergency surgery patient"
}
```

### Key Operations (CRUD):

1. **CREATE** - Make a new blood request
2. **READ** - View blood requests
3. **UPDATE** - Modify a blood request
4. **DELETE** - Remove a blood request

---

## 🔄 Part 5: How a Request Flows Through the System

### Example: Hospital Creates a Blood Request

```
Step 1: Hospital sends request to backend
   ⬇️
   POST /api/requests
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Body: { patient_name: "John", blood_group: "A+", ... }

Step 2: Request hits server.js
   ⬇️
   Server routes it to requestRoutes

Step 3: Auth middleware runs
   ⬇️
   auth() checks: "Is token valid?"
   ✅ YES → Continue
   ❌ NO → Return 401 error

Step 4: Role check middleware runs
   ⬇️
   checkRole('hospital') checks: "Is user a hospital?"
   ✅ YES → Continue
   ❌ NO → Return 403 error

Step 5: Controller function runs
   ⬇️
   createRequest() function executes
   - Validates data
   - Inserts into database
   - Returns success response

Step 6: Response sent back
   ⬇️
   { success: true, message: "Request created", request_id: 456 }
```

### Visual Flow:

```
User → Frontend → [Auth Check] → [Role Check] → Controller → Database
                      ↓               ↓              ↓           ↓
                   Valid?        Permission?    Process      Save Data
                                                  Logic
```

## 🔧 Part 6: Update Blood Request Explained

Let's break down the `updateRequest` function:

```javascript
exports.updateRequest = async (req, res) => {
  // Step 1: Get the request ID from URL
  const { id } = req.params;  // Example: /api/requests/123
  
  // Step 2: Get current user's info (from auth middleware)
  const userId = req.user.user_id;
  const userRole = req.user.role;

  // Step 3: Check if the request exists in database
  const [requests] = await db.query(
    'SELECT hospital_id FROM blood_requests WHERE request_id = ?',
    [id]
  );

  if (requests.length === 0) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Request not found' });
  }

  // Step 4: Security check - Can this user edit this request?
  // Rule: Only the hospital that created it OR an admin can edit
  if (requests[0].hospital_id !== userId && userRole !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
  }

  // Step 5: Build the UPDATE query dynamically
  // Only update fields that were sent
  const updates = [];
  const params = [];

  if (patient_name) {
    updates.push('patient_name = ?');
    params.push(patient_name);
  }
  if (blood_group) {
    updates.push('blood_group = ?');
    params.push(blood_group);
  }
  // ... etc for all fields

  // Step 6: Execute the update
  await db.query(
    `UPDATE blood_requests SET ${updates.join(', ')} WHERE request_id = ?`,
    params
  );

  // Step 7: Send success response
  res.json({ success: true, message: 'Updated successfully' });
};
```

**Why Build Updates Dynamically?**

Instead of updating ALL fields every time, we only update what changed:

```sql
-- Bad: Updates everything even if not changed
UPDATE blood_requests SET patient_name=?, blood_group=?, ... WHERE id=?

-- Good: Only updates what's needed
UPDATE blood_requests SET patient_name=? WHERE id=?
```

---

## 🚀 Part 7: Server Setup (server.js)

### What Does server.js Do?

It's the **main entry point** - the heart of the backend.

```javascript
const app = express();  // Create the application

// Step 1: Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
// Allows frontend (running on port 5173) to talk to backend (port 5000)
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:5173'],  // Allow requests from this URL
  credentials: true
}));

// Step 2: Parse incoming data
app.use(express.json());  // Understand JSON data in requests

// Step 3: Set up routes
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);        // /api/auth/* → authentication
app.use('/api/donors', donorRoutes);     // /api/donors/* → donor management
app.use('/api/requests', requestRoutes); // /api/requests/* → blood requests
app.use('/api/admin', adminRoutes);      // /api/admin/* → admin functions

// Step 4: Start the server
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 5000');
});
```

**Analogy:** server.js is like the **receptionist** at a hospital:
- Greets everyone who comes in (CORS)
- Understands their request (JSON parsing)
- Directs them to the right department (routing)
- Keeps the doors open (listening on port 5000)

---

## 🔑 Part 8: Admin Reset Script

### What Does `resetAdmin.js` Do?

It's a **utility script** to reset the admin password or create an admin if none exists.

```javascript
// Default admin credentials
email: 'admin@bloodbank.com'
password: 'Admin@123'

// Step 1: Hash the password (for security)
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

// Step 2: Check if admin exists
const [existingAdmin] = await db.query('SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);

if (existingAdmin.length > 0) {
  // Admin exists → Update password
  await db.query('UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE email = ?', [hashedPassword, email]);
} else {
  // No admin → Create new admin
  await db.query('INSERT INTO users (...) VALUES (...)', [fullName, email, hashedPassword, ...]);
}
```

**When to use this:**
- Forgot admin password
- Need to create first admin account
- Reset compromised admin account

**How to run:**
```bash
node backend/resetAdmin.js
```

## 📈 Complete Request Lifecycle Example

### Scenario: Dr. Smith at City Hospital needs 2 units of A+ blood urgently

```
1️⃣ FRONTEND: Hospital fills out form
   - Patient Name: John Doe
   - Blood Type: A+
   - Units: 2
   - Urgency: High

2️⃣ FRONTEND: Clicks "Submit Request"
   - Makes POST request to /api/requests
   - Includes JWT token in headers

3️⃣ BACKEND: Request arrives at server
   - server.js receives it
   - Routes to requestRoutes

4️⃣ AUTH MIDDLEWARE: Checks token
   - Is token valid? ✅
   - Finds user in database
   - Attaches user info to request

5️⃣ ROLE MIDDLEWARE: Checks permission
   - Is user a hospital? ✅
   - Allows request to continue

6️⃣ CONTROLLER: createRequest function
   - Validates all data
   - Inserts into blood_requests table
   - New request_id = 789 created

7️⃣ DATABASE: Saves the record
   INSERT INTO blood_requests (hospital_id, patient_name, ...) VALUES (...)

8️⃣ RESPONSE: Success sent back
   { success: true, message: "Request created", request_id: 789 }

9️⃣ FRONTEND: Shows success message
   "Blood request submitted successfully!"

🔟 NOTIFICATION: System can notify donors
   - "A+ blood needed urgently at City Hospital"
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts Summary

### 1. **Authentication vs Authorization**
- **Authentication** = "Who are you?" (Login, JWT tokens)
- **Authorization** = "What are you allowed to do?" (Roles, permissions)

### 2. **Middleware**
- Functions that run **before** your main code
- Like security checkpoints at an airport

### 3. **Database Views**
- Pre-written queries saved in the database
- Like a bookmark or saved search

### 4. **REST API**
- GET = Read data
- POST = Create new data
- PUT/PATCH = Update data
- DELETE = Remove data

### 5. **Error Codes**
- **200** = Success
- **401** = Not authenticated (no token or invalid token)
- **403** = Not authorized (logged in, but no permission)
- **404** = Not found
- **500** = Server error

---

## 🤔 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Why use JWT instead of sessions?
**A:** JWT is **stateless** - the server doesn't need to remember tokens. It's like a stamped passport vs. a guest list.

### Q: Why hash passwords?
**A:** Security! If someone steals the database, they can't see actual passwords. Hashing is a one-way process.

### Q: What's the point of the connection pool?
**A:** Efficiency! Creating a new database connection is slow. A pool keeps connections ready to use.

### Q: Why separate routes, controllers, and models?
**A:** **Organization!** Each file has one job:
- Routes = "What URLs exist?"
- Controllers = "What happens at this URL?"
- Models = "How do we interact with database?"

### Q: What if a blood request expires?
**A:** The VIEW (`inventory_expiring_soon`) helps identify expiring blood. The system can:
1. Alert hospitals to use it soon
2. Automatically mark as expired
3. Send to waste if not used
